# GitHub Actions composite action for WordPress test setup

This repository contains a [composite action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-composite-action)
used in conjunction with 
[resuable workflows](https://github.com/penske-media-corp/github-workflows-wordpress) 
to prepare a WordPress theme or plugin for testing. This action is tailored to 
PMC's specific needs and is not directly usable by other organizations, 
though it can provide a starting point for other organizations that maintain 
multiple WordPress themes and an accompanying set of plugins contained in a 
monorepo.
